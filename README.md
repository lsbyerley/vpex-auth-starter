# vpex-auth-starter
Vue, Parcel, Express starter app with Firebase Authentication

This repo is a somewhat barebones starting point for buildling a web app with a front-end powered by VueJS and a backend powered by ExpressJS. For simplicities sake, the front-end javascript is bundled using ParcelJS. User authentication is built with the Firebase SDK and by default is setup to the email/password sign-in method.
